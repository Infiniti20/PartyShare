# PartyShare
The updated version of PartyShare. This version has all of the new changes and features, like Firebase authentication, TypeScript, and asynchronous sqlite3. 
These changes will allow the project to be updated in the future with ease, which will be important. 
This version is also a lot more scalable, with better experience for vendor and customers alike, whereas previously the vendor experience was lacking.
