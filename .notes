Using SSL (Server side logic), I request a specific document from Cloud Firestore. This is a list of all the dates. 

I use the returnDate property to create a date range, which is a timeframe of all of the product quantities and their availability.

The date range is an object, where each date has a corresponding number, which is the quantity.

I now load up an array of all the invalid dates, from the date range object. These are the dates where the quantLeft property is under 1.

When the dates are selected, I check the quantity of the start date. This is the maximum you can choose.
